- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jonatan-Ramirez-Marroquin, a highly motivated and detail-oriented recent graduate with a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
- I have a strong academic foundation and a passion for software development. I'm exploring opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting and contribute to innovative projects.
- I'm seeking to utilize excellent communication, interpersonal, and organizational skills to complete tasks. I'm a reliable person with a good work ethic and the ability to quickly adapt to new tasks and environments.
- I'm interested in learning new technologies and developing useful pieces of software given my knowledge of object-oriented programming languages. Android App development caught my attention this past school year, and I'm hoping to extend my knowledge in this topic.
- I recently graduated in May 2025 from UIUC.
- I'm open to learning and mastering new programming languages and concepts to apply to my software projects.
